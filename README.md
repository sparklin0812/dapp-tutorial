# 📝 dapp development tutorial

This tutorial is created based on Alchemy's [Hello World Part 4 Tutorial](https://app.gitbook.com/@alchemyapi/s/alchemy/tutorials/hello-world-smart-contract/creating-a-full-stack-dapp).

This repository contains the starter files (`starter-files`) and completed version (`completed`)

## ℹ️ About the tutorial

In this tutorial, we will teach you how to create a full stack dApp by connecting your UBC Token smart contract to a React frontend using Metamask and Web3 tools.

## 🤔 Note

Niether the `starter-files` nor `completed` have their `node_modules` folder. Before running `npm start` in your terminal to start the React project, run `npm install` to download all the package dependencies.
